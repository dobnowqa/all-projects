# How to update your DOBNOW automation scripts:
# 1. It's a good idea to make a backup copy of your dob folder - C:\framework\eclipse-workspace\dob.
# 2. Go to https://github.com/dobnowqa/all-projects.
# 3. Click green button “Clone or download’.
# 4. Click “Download ZIP”.
# 5. Go to: downloads folder (usually C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads).
# 6. Extract “all-projects-master.zip”.
# 7. Rename “all-projects-master” to “dob”.
# 8. Copy “dob” to your workspace (C:\framework\eclipse-workspace) over-writing the “dob” folder already there.
